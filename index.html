  <h1>Graph based Immutable Build Systems</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>TL;WR:</strong>
    Graph based Immutable Build Systems (GIBS)<sup>1</sup> are here to stay. 
    We believe that they provide a superior way to build software.
  </p>
  <p>
    This purpose of this manifesto is twofold:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      It tries to <a href="#why">convince you</a> that this is indeed, building software with a GIBS has advantages.
    </li>
    <li>
      These systems put some constraints on how a package manager can interact with the global
      state and the programmer.
      We <a href="#package-manager-suggestions">provide some suggestions</a> on which role a package manager for some programming language
      should play, and which features could improve the experience of building
      software in an arbirary language with a GIBS.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    1: eg. Nix, Guix, Bazel, Habitat.sh
  </p>

  <h2 id="why">Why Graph based Immutable Build Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Graph based immutable build systems are concerned with building and managing the dependencies of
    a single program, several programs or even entire operating systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core principle that all these systems share is that it is impossible to have implicit
    dependencies; only explicitly specified dependencies can be used. We distinguish between
    build-time dependencies (like a compiler) and run-time dependencies (a shared library, or a
    package for your favorite programming language).
  </p>
  <p>
    This isolation is achieved by storing each created artifact in an immutable location,
    and only making it availble when explicitly requested.
    This is very hard to accomplish in traditional software distributions, where programs and 
    libraries are installed in well known locations, such as <code>/usr/bin</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This strict isolation is the opposite of the approach taken by e.g. Docker, where the motto
    appears to be "anything goes, as long as it works".
  </p>
  <p>
    One could argue that Docker is advocating the use of <code>goto</code>, whilst graph based
    dependencies are arguing for the more limited (but saner) structured programming approach.
  </p>
  <p>
    These imposed limitations --having to specify both run-time and build-time dependencies--,
    pay off in multiple ways. The full dependency graph will be come queryable, allowing automated
    tools to take advantage of this information to e.g. automatically check for vulnerabilities
    based on semantical information, instead of scanning for binary patterns.
    An additional feature in this context is that not only we can detect if our system contains 
    some vulnerable piece of software, but we also know by which components it is used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each run-time dependency can be shipped separately to the production environment; no
    need to copy your gigabyte sized layer containing the same packages over and over again,
    because you changed a one kilobyte dependency. Your build-time dependencies will never
    be shipped to production.
    Futhermore, because the exactly build dependencies for your application are specified,
    we can automatically create a development environment that is identical to the CI/build
    environment, on your local machine, without containers or VM's. <sup>2</sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    2: of course you'd need to be running linux to fully take advantage of this. However,
    nixpkgs also runs on top of OSX. You'll be able to get closer to prod-parity than ever before,
    because the exact versions of the used software will be pinned to the same values. However,
    OSX != Linux, so you might experience some subtle semantic issues.

  <h2 id="package-manager-suggestions">Package managers & GIBS</h2>
  <h3>GIBS unifies OS and dev package management</h3>
  <p>
    In most (operating) systems package managers thar are used to manage operating systems and the
    ones used by programmers to manage the dependencies of theyr programming languages are at war.
  </p>
  <p>
    The operating systems prefer to have more stable, less frequent releases with long support
    lifetimes, and one set of libraries for the whole operating system.
    Most non-gibs operating systems do not support installing more than one version of e.g.
    <code>glibc</code> or <code>openssl</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, developers often prefer to have more recent versions of libraries to work against.
    They might have to work with pieces of software that require older (or newer) versions
    of libraries than that are provided by the operating system.
  </p>
  <p>
   This conflict is hard to reconcile. Quite often, the libraries used by developers resort to including
   e.g. <code>openssl</code> or <code>libxml</code> directly in their source repositories.
   This will potentially lead to an umanagable set of different versions of libraries.
   TODO: example nokogiri ruby
  </p>
  <p>
    In a GIBS, there is no black-and-white distiction on which libraries are provided by the
    base operating system, and which are packaged by the programmers themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    By having the graph model, packages can be inspected and it can be automatically verified
    that e.g. no old versions of <code>openssl</code>are in use.
  </p>

  <h3>How most package managers for programming languages works today</h3>
  <p>
    Most programming languages today, offer two ways to install libraries managed by those tools.
